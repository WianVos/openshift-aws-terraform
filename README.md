# openshift-aws-terraform
Create AWS infrastructure and install RedHat Openshift, according to the
[reference architecture](https://blog.openshift.com/openshift-container-platform-reference-architecture-implementation-guides/).

This repo is currently a work in progress, so use at your own risk. Any suggestions
and/or contributions are most welcome.

# Roadmap
In the future I will probably rename the repo and add support for other providers
(GCP, Azure, VMWare) as well. Please feel free to submit issues and PRs!

# Inspiration
This repo was heavily inspired by:
- https://github.com/dwmkerr/terraform-aws-openshift
- https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib
